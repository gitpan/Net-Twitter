    Net::Twitter - Perl interface to twitter.com

VERSION
    This document describes Net::Twitter version 1.0

SYNOPSIS
        #!/usr/bin/perl
        use Net::Twitter;
        
        my $bot = Net::Twitter->new(username=>"myuser", password=>"mypass" );

DESCRIPTION
	http://www.twitter.com provides a web 2.0 type of ubiquitous presence.
	This module allows you to set your status, as well as the statuses of
	your friends.

INTERFACE
    Net::Twitter exports the following methods.

    ` new '
        You must pass a hash containing username and password to "new".

    ` update '
        Set your current status. This returns a hashref containing your most
	recent status.
	
     ` friends '
        This returns a hashref containing the most recent status of those you
	have marked as friends in twitter.

     ` friends_timeline '
        This returns a hashref containing the timeline of those you
	have marked as friends in twitter.

     ` friends_timeline '
        This returns a hashref containing the public timeline of all twitter
	users.
	
     ` followers '
        This returns a hashref containing the timeline of those who follow your
	status in twitter..


CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
    Net::Twitter uses LWP internally. Any environment variables that LWP
    supports should be supported by Net::Twitter. I hope.

DEPENDENCIES

    JSON::Syck
    
INCOMPATIBILITIES
    None reported.
