NAME
    Net::Twitter - Perl interface to twitter.com

VERSION
    This document describes Net::Twitter version 1.0.1

SYNOPSIS
    #!/usr/bin/perl

    use Net::Twitter;

    my $bot = Net::Twitter->new(username=>"myuser", password=>"mypass" );

    $bot->update("My current Status");

DESCRIPTION
    http://www.twitter.com provides a web 2.0 type of ubiquitous presence.
    This module allows you to set your status, as well as the statuses of
    your friends.

INTERFACE
    Net::Twitter exports the following methods.

    " new "
        You must supply a hash containing the configuration for the
        connection.

        Valid configuration items are:

        " username "
            Username of your account at twitter.com. This is usually your
            email address. REQUIRED.

        " password "
            Password of your account at twitter.com. REQUIRED.

        " apiurl "
            OPTIONAL. The URL of the API for twitter.com. This defaults to "
            http://twitter.com/statuses " if not set.

        " apihost "
        " apirealm "
            OPTIONAL: If you do point to a different URL, you will also need
            to set " apihost " and " apirealm " so that the internal LWP can
            authenticate.

            " apihost " defaults to " www.twitter.com:80 ".

            " apirealm " defaults to " Twitter API ".

    " update "
        Set your current status. This returns a hashref containing your most
        recent status. Returns undef if an error occurs.

    " friends "
        This returns a hashref containing the most recent status of those
        you have marked as friends in twitter. Returns undef if an error
        occurs.

    " friends_timeline "
        This returns a hashref containing the timeline of those you have
        marked as friends in twitter. Returns undef if an error occurs.

    " public_timeline "
        This returns a hashref containing the public timeline of all twitter
        users. Returns undef if an error occurs.

    " followers "
        This returns a hashref containing the timeline of those who follow
        your status in twitter.. Returns undef if an error occurs.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
    Net::Twitter uses LWP internally. Any environment variables that LWP
    supports should be supported by Net::Twitter. I hope.

DEPENDENCIES
    LWP::UserAgent
    JSON::Syck (preferred) or JSON

INCOMPATIBILITIES
    None reported.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    No bugs have been reported.

AUTHOR
    Chris Thompson <cpan@cthompson.com>

    The framework of this module is shamelessly stolen from Net::AIML. Big
    ups to Chris "peregrin" Prather for that.

    The fallback code to load JSON or JSON::Syck is also from Chris Prather.
