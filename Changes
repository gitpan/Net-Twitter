Revision history for Net-Twitter

1.0.0 - Wed Mar 07, 2007
        First Release

1.0.1 - Wed Mar 07, 2007
        o Removed dependancy on Module::Build and version
	o Added code from Chris Prather to fall back to pure
	  perl JSON if JSON::Syck is not found.
	o Fixed POD inconsistencies.
	o Added apiurl, apihost and apirealm config options to new

1.02 - 	Thu Mar 08, 2007
	o Fixed Makefile.PL to remove leftover require of version
	o It's "perigrin", not "peregrin"
	o Added PREREQ for JSON. JSON::Syck is highly recommended though.
	o Changed version scheme from three segments to two, I never
	  wanted three digits to begin with, but Module::Build did it
	  without asking.

1.03 - 	Tue Mar 20, 2007
	o added $self->credentials() to allow changing user/pass to attach to
	  without having to create mulitple objects. This is especially 
	  helpful with POE Wheels.
	o Cleaned up documentation.
	o Added note about the twitter account for Net::Twitter itself
	  at http://twitter.com/net_twitter
