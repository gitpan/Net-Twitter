Revision history for Net-Twitter

2.00_04 - Sat Jan 10, 2009
	o Remove result hack for relationship_exists as twitter has fixed their end.
	o Completely rework arg validation to allow calling with no args, yet trapping 
		where this is wrong.
	o Add JSON eval trapping to regular methods, it was mistakenly only 
		happening on search.
	o Massive POD rewrites to clarify and expand, and even correct a few mistakes.
	
2.00_03 - Fri Jan 9, 2009
	o Add Net::Identica which wraps a Net::Twitter object and sets the default connection to identi.ca
	o Fix show_user argument handling which was broken to this point
	o Add full search API
	o Trap errors in JSON decoding when Twitter returns a 200 Success, preventing JSON::Any from die-ing
	o Various POD fixes and updates
	
2.00_02 - Wed Jan 7, 2009
	o Applied http://github.com/semifor/net-twitter/commit/34b042f653d3c9c39f0003504070b4014da7d854
	o Applied logic from patch to 1.xx by Chris Nelson to prevent bad JSON from 
		causing JSON::Any to die. JSON errors should now gracefully return undef.
	o POD change, spurious h in the URL for rt.cpan.org
	o Updated copyright to 2009
	o Add IRC and other contact info.

2.00_01 - Mon Dec 22, 2008
	o From scratch redo. All the old code is gone and replaced with new.
	o Changes against 1.xx include:
		o identica quick switch to new() to set identi.ca connect info
		o Full arg validation. This can be bypassed.
		o All methods are now generated dynamically from a lookup 
		  table at runtime.
