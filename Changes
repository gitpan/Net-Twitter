3.03003 2009-07-07
    - Fixed a typo in Makefile.PL

3.03002 2009-07-04
    - Updated documentation to include callback parameter to get_authorization_url
    - Different OAuth nonce algorithm avoids duplicates in forked processes
    - Bumped JSON version dependencies for better JSON boolean handling

3.03001 2009-06-29
    - Updated to Moose 0.85
    - Properly subclassed top level Net::Twitter modules

3.03000 2009-06-25
    - Twitter API update:
        - Added screen_name and user_id parameters to new_direct_message
        - Added show_friendship method (friendships/show.json)

    - Made Net::Twitter safe for subclassing

    - Added "authenticate" parameter handling. By default REST API methods
      inclued an Authorization header; Search API methods do not. Can be
      overridden with "authenticate => 0|1".  This finally allows getting
      rate_limit_status by user (the default), or by IP address, with
      ->rate_limit_status({ authenticate => 0 }).

    - Added a workaround for JSON backends that don't handle booleans properly

3.00002 2009-06-01
