Revision history for Net-Twitter

2.04 - Sat Jan 24, 2009
	o More tweaks from Marc Mims on regression tests
	o Reworked bad arg handling which caused subsequent calls of several methods to fail.
	o Fixed issue with arg handling in show_status
	o Removed Net::Twitter::Search until I can get assistance from Brenda, CPAN complains that I don't have
		rights to the namespace and people are reporting problems finding 2.x because the index is off.
	o Switch to using Module::Install

2.03 - Thu Jan 22, 2009
	o Bad MANIFEST kept the regression tests out of the 2.02 distribution.
	o Change clienturl to default to http://www.net-twitter.info and removed pointless XML warning.
	
2.02 - Thu Jan 22, 2009
	o Add arrayref_on_error switch at the suggestion of Ryan Rose. Changes default return value on error.
	o Added regression test suite by Marc Mims, hopefully no more crappy releases missing things.
	o Fixed several bugs in arg handling and validation to make it work correctly. Should now be 100%

2.01 - Fri Jan 16, 2009
	o Add back in the inexplicably missing update_twittervision
	o Fixed several errors with methods that can take a single arg, not a hashref. This has to happen
		for back compat with 1.xx
	o Patch from semifor to fix args handling on GET methods. It worked but was semantically wrong.
	
2.00 - Thu Jan 15, 2009
	o Final release including all of the below.
	o Differences since 2.00_05
		o Added Net::Twitter::Search stub file to act as a wrapper.
		o Added clone() method
		o More POD cleanup.
		o Switched from die/warn to Carp::carp/croak

2.00_05 - Mon Jan 12, 2009
	o 2.00_04 had a glaring error that prevented anything that used an HTTP POST, 
		like update(), from actually, you know, POSTing.
	o Great suggestion from semifor on passing form values to LWP::UserAgent replaced 34 lines of
		ridiculous arg handling with 3 lines and a call to URI. Much better.
	o Yet more POD and minor tweaks.

2.00_04 - Sat Jan 10, 2009
	o Remove result hack for relationship_exists as twitter has fixed their end.
	o Completely rework arg validation to allow calling with no args, yet trapping 
		where this is wrong.
	o Add JSON eval trapping to regular methods, it was mistakenly only 
		happening on search.
	o Massive POD rewrites to clarify and expand, and even correct a few mistakes.
	
2.00_03 - Fri Jan 9, 2009
	o Add Net::Identica which wraps a Net::Twitter object and sets the default connection to identi.ca
	o Fix show_user argument handling which was broken to this point
	o Add full search API
	o Trap errors in JSON decoding when Twitter returns a 200 Success, preventing JSON::Any from die-ing
	o Various POD fixes and updates
	
2.00_02 - Wed Jan 7, 2009
	o Applied http://github.com/semifor/net-twitter/commit/34b042f653d3c9c39f0003504070b4014da7d854
	o Applied logic from patch to 1.xx by Chris Nelson to prevent bad JSON from 
		causing JSON::Any to die. JSON errors should now gracefully return undef.
	o POD change, spurious h in the URL for rt.cpan.org
	o Updated copyright to 2009
	o Add IRC and other contact info.

2.00_01 - Mon Dec 22, 2008
	o From scratch redo. All the old code is gone and replaced with new.
	o Changes against 1.xx include:
		o identica quick switch to new() to set identi.ca connect info
		o Full arg validation. This can be bypassed.
		o All methods are now generated dynamically from a lookup 
		  table at runtime.
