Net::Twitter::API - Moose sugar for defining Twitter API methods

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package My::Twitter::API;
  use Moose::Role;
  use Net::Twitter::API;

  use namespace::autoclean;

  has apiurl => ( isa => 'Str', is => 'rw', default => 'http://twitter.com' );

  base_url 'apiurl';

  twitter_api_method friends_timeline => (
      description => <<'',
  Returns the 20 most recent statuses posted by the authenticating user
  and that user's friends. This is the equivalent of /home on the Web.

      aliases   => [qw/following_timeline/],
      path      => 'statuses/friends_timeline',
      method    => 'GET',
      params    => [qw/since_id max_id count page/],
      required  => [],
      returns   => 'ArrayRef[Status]',
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides some Moose sugar for defining Twitter API methods.  It is part
of the Net-Twitter distribution on CPAN and is used by C<Net::Twitter::API::REST>,
C<Net::Twitter::API::Search>, and perhaps others.

It's intent is to make maintaining C<Net::Twitter> as easy as possible.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item base_url

Specifies, by name, the attribute which contains the base URL for the defined API.

=item twitter_api_method

Defines a Twitter API method.  Valid arguments are:

=item authenticate

Specifies whether, by default, API methods calls should authenticate.

=over 4

=item description

A string describing the method, suitable for documentation.

=item aliases

An ARRAY ref of strings containing alternate names for the method.

=item path

A string containing the path part of the API URL

=item method

A string containing the HTTP method for the call.  Defaults to "GET".

=item add_source

A boolean, indicating whether or not the C<source> parameter should be added
to the API call.  (The source value is assigned by Twitter for registered
applications.)  Defaults to 0.

=item params

An ARRAY ref of strings naming all of the valid parameters.  Defaults to an
empty ARRAY ref.

=item required

An ARRAY ref of strings naming all of the required parameters.  Defaults to an
empty ARRAY ref.

=item returns

A string describing the return type of the API method call.

=item deprecated

A boolean indicating whether or not this API is deprecated.  If set to 1, code
for the method will be created.  This option is optional, and is used by the
C<Net-Twitter> distribution when generating documentation.  It defaults to 0.
